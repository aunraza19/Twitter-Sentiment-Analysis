## Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
# Sentiment Analysis with CNN Using Keras and TensorFlow
# Overview

This project implements Sentiment Analysis on tweets using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Keras and TensorFlow. The goal is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their sentiment.

# Features

Preprocesses tweets by cleaning text and tokenizing words.

Uses a CNN model for sentiment classification.

Evaluates performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Visualizes training history (loss and accuracy curves).

# Installation

Install the required dependencies:

pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

# Dataset

The dataset consists of tweets labeled with their sentiment.

It is preprocessed by removing noise, tokenizing, and encoding labels.

Data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

# Preprocessing Steps

Convert tweets to lowercase.

Remove special characters and unnecessary spaces.

Tokenize and pad text sequences for CNN input.

Encode sentiment labels into numerical values.

# Model Architecture

Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vector representations.

1D CNN Layer: Extracts text features.

MaxPooling Layer: Reduces dimensionality.

Flatten Layer: Converts feature maps into a vector.

Fully Connected Layers: Classifies sentiments into categories.

#Training the Model

Run the following command to train the model:

python train.py

Optimizer: Adam

Loss Function: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy

Epochs: 5

Batch Size: 32

Model Evaluation

To evaluate the model on test data:

python evaluate.py

Prints test accuracy and loss.

Displays confusion matrix.

Inference (Predict Sentiment)

Use the trained model to predict sentiment:

python predict.py --text "I love this product!"

# Results

Test Accuracy: Displayed after evaluation.

Confusion Matrix: Helps visualize classification performance.

Training Graphs: Show loss and accuracy trends.

# Future Improvements

Experiment with RNNs, LSTMs, or Transformers.

Fine-tune hyperparameters for better performance.

Train on larger datasets for better generalization.
